## 📝 Overview

LabScribe AI Sheets is an AI-powered laboratory documentation generator that streamlines the process of creating professional lab reports. It combines neural network technology with a modern user interface to automate and standardize laboratory documentation.
The objective of this project is to develop a web-based application that generates structured and professionally formatted labsheets based on user-provided experimental data and findings. This tool is not intended to bypass or undermine the academic effort required from students, but rather to assist in organizing, formatting, and presenting their work in a consistent and polished manner. By allowing students to input their experiment-specific results, observations, and discussions, the application ensures that each labsheet remains unique to the individual's effort and understanding. Ultimately, this project aims to enhance academic productivity by reducing the time spent on formatting, while maintaining full integrity and ownership of the student's original work.
